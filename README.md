# My First Mobile App Project!
The following Android Studio project was created as an application challenge as a pre requisite for a job interview. All of the front end design and included features were shown to me through screenshots in my project requirements, so while the app was made by me from scratch, any assets (like pictures, descriptions, or other content) was provided by Bushel (contact@bushelpowered.com), a local company in Fargo. So credit for this project does not go to me. That being said, this project was completed close to within a week in September of 2019 (beginning of my sophomore year), with the majority of the work done in a single weekend. Previous to this project, I had not used Android Studio, or developed any mobile applications. I also hadn't previously used Postman, a software for visualizing calls to an API, nor had I even used gitHub. While this showcase doesn't showcase my design skills, Hopefully this project can showcase my ability to pick up new programs for developing software quickly.
