# This Project Is Finished!
I'm all done devloping an the android Event Board app! It's been great to learn new coding skills and accomplish the challenge provided. Let me know if you have any questions or need me to send my project in another format, and I'll be happy to do so! I hope to hear from you soon!

# First Upload! 9/28/19
Currently, I have developed the following few things:
  - The Layout to the Login Screen
  - Validating that username and password fields have input before allowing a login
  - A POST request to the api to post the user information
  - storing the response from the login POST request as a Token
  - Opening The second Activity for the scrollable Event List
  - Making a GET request from the api to retrieve the list of events and store them as Event objects.
  - Used Token string as a header of authorization for retrieving event list
  - Printing the Error message should the call to the API and server fail

New things I have learned in order to complete these steps:
  - How to use GitHub
  - How to use Android Studio IDE
  - How to use Retrofit to make requests from a server
  - How to use Postman to better visualize API calls
  
I will be updating this page very soon with further progress towards this project. Thanks for keeping an eye out for my work, as well as for all the help you have given me!

# I'm Getting Close! 9/29/19
New Features Developed:
  - The Layout to the RecyclerView Events List page
  - RecyclerViewAdapter class (to create the recycler view)
  - Posted event images in RecyclerView
  - Posted event titles and formatted times in RecyclerView
  - Created a custom toolbar with an overflow menu with one Log Out option
  - Allowed for Marquee text with long event titles (all titles fit on one line)
  - Created Layout template for individual events page (not yet specific to the event)
  
New things I learned in order to complete these steps:
  - How to create a recycler view
  - using Picasso to load and display images (easy)

So I am coming to a finish on this project! The core few things I have left to do is to implement a Log out function, transfer event id's between two activities, and format the event details into the third and final layout! I'll be getting some work done tomorrow, so look for an update to this repository and README!

# I Have Completed the Challenge! 9/30/19
New Features Developed:
  - Making a GET request to retrieve details relative to the event
  - Making a GET request to retrieve details relative to the speaker
  - adding details from GET requests to the EventActivity
  - ability to add all speaker info if there are multiple speakers
  - Ability to Log out when overflow menu option is selected

New things I have learned in order to complete these steps:
  - Using a Linear Layout
  - passing information between different activities (id and authorization token for API requests)
  
  And That's everything! I'ts been an absolutely wonderful experience to develop this app and learn Android app development and all the processes involved! I hope that you enjoy the work that you see here and if you need me to send my project in another format or have any questions for me let me know! Thanks!
